*The Atlas of Housing Production* is an inventory of existing protocols for producing housing in Mexico. *The Atlas* describes the processes of financing, sourcing materials, designing, and organizing labor to build a house, as they are carried out by Tosepan, Antorcha Campesina, commercial banks, government agencies, and real estate developers. Rather than prescribing a single, ideal solution, *The Atlas* presents a set of equally valid possibilities, flattening the hierarchy between allegedly expert and non-expert knowledge. By laying bare the virtues and shortcomings of each of these processes, *The Atlas* gives agency to its users, allowing them to make informed decisions on how they wish to obtain a house. Finally, by splitting the process into its component parts, *The Atlas* allows its readers to recombine them for imagining new forms of housing production.
