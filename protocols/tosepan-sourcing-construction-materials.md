If you build your house with Tosepan, most of the materials will come from two cooperatives in the Tosepan network: Tichanchiuaj and Ojtasentekitinij.
Because the towns in the mountains of Puebla are so remote, there are no financial incentives for a commercial construction materials store to operate in the region. Tosepan Tichanchiuaj solves this by bringing industrial building materials such as rebar, cement, sand, and gravel into the region, and by locally producing CMU and adobe blocks.

The cooperative also lowers the cost of these materials by buying in bulk from suppliers and passing the savings to you. Additionally, when you start a project, they will fix the prices for the duration of the construction, protecting you from changes in prices. Most of the construction workers in the region know how to build using these materials, which are also common in the more urban settings where they work.

Tosepan Ojtasentekitinij transforms bamboo that people grow on their land into construction materials or furniture. First, they will teach you how to grow bamboo in your land. When it is ready, they will collect it and process it in their shop. And they will give it back either as assembled furniture or as material for building your own structures. Because bamboo is not a native species, there are no traditional construction techniques for bamboo in the region. Instead, members of the cooperative have developed a system for making joints using threaded rods and nuts.

Tosepan has promoted the use of bamboo because it is a cheap, locally produced, non-industrial material, and the auditorium in their headquarters is a geodesic dome made of bamboo. However, it is much easier to comply with the standards set by the federal agencies that provide housing subsidies using industrial materials.
