Apart from getting technical assistance when they apply to the government subsidy, you will get assistance with design and construction. The cooperative has an architecture team led by Viviana Vázquez Cabrera, who studied architecture in the nearby city of Puebla. Along with another two or three other professionally trained architects and a team of 18 supervisors, they assist each family with design, budgeting, and construction, accompanying them during the entire process.

First, a promotor will meet with you to design the house. They will draw the existing site and whatever constructions are there. After an interview with the family, you will design your house with the promotor. Because the program requires that the entire design and construction process take four months, each supervisor will oversee around a hundred projects per year, in four-month batches.

Although you can build your house with your own labor, you will most likely hire local construction workers. Some of these construction workers have gone on to become supervisors, and although supervisors don’t necessarily make more money, they employment is steady. The typical team consists of one manager (*responsable*), an additional master builder (*maestro*), two officials (*oficiales*), and two assistants (*chalanes*).
