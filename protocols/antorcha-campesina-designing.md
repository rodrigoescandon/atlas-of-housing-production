While Antorcha Campesina will not help you design your house or manage its construction, they will design the neighborhood (*colonia*) where you will live. They will subdivide the land to be squatted into an orthogonal grid, an urban design that is easy to trace and manage. Then, they will set up three key infrastructures: a construction materials store, a supermarket, and a public school. The materials store and supermarket allow the organization to profit from the consumers in their newly created captive market of landowners, who need construction materials and food. However, the public school serves an additional political purpose, allowing the organization to get state funded teaching positions and seats in the powerful schoolteacher’s union. 

For the design and construction of your house, you will hire a team of local construction workers, usually consisting in one or two master builders (*maestro*), one or two officials (*oficiales*), and one or two assistants (*chalanes*). You will decide the design of your house with the team of construction workers. Although you will not be following a manual, your house will be very similar to your neighbors’, as it will be modeled on other houses that the builders you hired have produced.
