If you build your house with Antorcha Campesina, most of the construction materials will come from the local construction materials store.

As soon as Antorcha Campesina subdivides a large piece of land for people to squat, they open a construction materials store that sells industrial building materials such as rebar, cement, sand, and gravel into the region, and by locally producing CMU and adobe blocks. Antorcha Campesina prides itself from being an independent organization which, unlike political parties, does not receive money from the state and is instead funded by ventures such as this one. However, these stores are for profit, and the leaders of the movement benefit from them.

Because you need to occupy the land from the beginning, first you will build a temporary structure with cheap materials, such as corrugated metal, wood, or cardboard. Then, you will save until you can start building with more permanent materials You will use this very quality–the fact that these materials are durable–to save buy accumulating them instead of making deposits into a bank account that would additionally earn you an interest. This means that you end up paying twice: first for a temporary house and then for a more permanent one.
